Robotics is a study dealing with the design, construction, operation and application of robots. Robotics is at the intersection of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, electronics, information technology, artificial intelligence, and other fields.
Its goal is to help people perform various tasks by creating intelligent machines. These machines may be able to sense, make decisions, move and interact with their environment.
Robots are found in a variety of applications, including industry (working on production lines), healthcare (surgical robots ), transportation (self-driving vehicles, drones), and many other fields. Robotics is a dynamically developing field that contributes to modern society by introducing many new technologies and innovations.
